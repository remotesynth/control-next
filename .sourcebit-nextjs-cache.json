Operating on a national scale, the FBC investigates events and objects which violate the known laws of nature, with the goal of understanding and controlling these elements. The Bureau's headquarters is a mysterious Brutalist skyscraper in New York City known as the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House \"Oldest House\"), which exists outside of ordinary reality.\n\n![FBC](/images/5XF89csDUQ2HoBxiQJjrac-FBC.png)\n\nThe FBC is responsible for both the scientific study of paranatural elements and the protection of the nation (and humanity as a whole) from these forces. Among the phenomena studied by the FBC are [Altered World Events](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/AWE \"AWE\") (AWEs), [Altered Items](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Altered_Items \"Altered Items\"), [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Object_of_Power \"Object of Power\"), and other realms and dimensions beyond our own.

Originating from an alternate dimension, the Hiss influenced FBC Director [Zachariah Trench](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Zachariah_Trench \"Zachariah Trench\") into unleashing it using the [Slide Projector](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Slide_Projector \"Slide Projector\") [Object of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Object_of_Power \"Object of Power\"). The Hiss's source of resonance was cut off by [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden \"Jesse Faden\") when she deactivated the Projector; however, the possessed Hiss agents still lingered in the Oldest House, continuing to pose a major threat.\n\nThe Hiss originated from an alternate dimension which could be reached via one of the slides connected to the [Slide Projector](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Slide_Projector \"Slide Projector\") [Object of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Object_of_Power \"Object of Power\") from [Ordinary, Wisconsin](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ordinary \"Ordinary\"). During the [Ordinary AWE](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ordinary_AWE \"Ordinary AWE\"), [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden \"Jesse Faden\") burned all but one of the slides ([Slidescape-36](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Slidescape-36 \"Slidescape-36\")), and the Projector was contained by the [FBC](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/FBC \"FBC\"). [Zachariah Trench](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Zachariah_Trench \"Zachariah Trench\") kept one of the burned slides. As exploration of Slidescape-36 was carried out under the supervision of [Casper Darling](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Casper_Darling \"Casper Darling\"), Trench, attending one of the expeditions, fell under the influence of the Hiss. When Darling returned the [Hedron](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Hedron \"Hedron\") from Slidescape-36 and began to produce [HRAs](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/HRA \"HRA\"), Trench, fearing Hedron would take over the entire Bureau, unleashed the Hiss upon the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House \"Oldest House\") on [October 29, 2019](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Hiss_invasion \"Hiss invasion\"). The Hiss nearly destroyed the entire Bureau, possessing its agents, the topography of the Oldest House, and numerous [Altered Items](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Altered_Items \"Altered Items\") and Objects of Power.

Appearing in the form of an enormous inverted black pyramid, the Board appears to be responsible for selecting the [Director](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control \"Director of the Federal Bureau of Control\") of the [Federal Bureau of Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Control \"Federal Bureau of Control\"), while also possessing various connections to [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Objects_of_Power \"Objects of Power\") within ordinary reality. The true nature and motivations of the Board are unknown.\n\nThe Board is a mysterious and powerful entity or group of entities that exists within the [Astral Plane](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Astral_Plane \"Astral Plane\"), a vast alternate dimension connected to the human collective unconscious. The Board appears in the form of a large, inverted black pyramid hovering within the Astral Plane, and communicates primarily through seemingly telepathic messages in a complex language that can be understood partially by [parautilitarians](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Parautilitarian \"Parautilitarian\"). As represented in subtitles, many of the terms used by the Board have multiple, often contradictory meanings, creating a juxtaposition in their communication; it is unknown if this results from a difficulty the Board faces in translating its messages, or a disagreement within the Board itself. In one instance, the Board told [Jesse Faden](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Jesse_Faden \"Jesse Faden\") to simply ignore it due to the difficulty of communicating their message.\n\nThe origins and nature of the Board are unknown, but [Bureau](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/FBC \"FBC\") research suggests the Board possesses a strong, perhaps intrinsic connection to the [Oldest House](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Oldest_House \"Oldest House\"). The Board attributes its origins, as well as the House's, to the [Foundation](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Foundation \"Foundation\"), located in the [Black Rock Quarry](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Rock_Quarry \"Black Rock Quarry\"). The Board possesses immense paranatural powers and a connection to [Objects of Power](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Objects_of_Power \"Objects of Power\"), and ordain [rituals](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Ritual \"Ritual\") enabling certain parautilitarians to bind to these OoPs and utilize their powers; it is unknown if these connections are natural, or merely imposed by the Board itself. The Board is not the only entity to exist within the Astral Plane, as other entities - such as [Former](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Former \"Former\") - have been shown to impose their own connections to Altered Items and consensus reality. The [Service Weapon](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Service_Weapon \"Service Weapon\") appears to be one of the most significant OoPs to the Board; the individual chosen by the Board to wield it is implied to possess immense paranatural abilities, enabling them to control all other Objects of Power. As a result, the FBC, with the primary goal of controlling paranatural phenomena, ordains this individual as the Bureau's [Director](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Control \"Director of the Federal Bureau of Control\").\n\nThe Board possesses somewhat metafictional tendencies, and many of its telepathic messages make references to elements of *[Control](https://control.fandom.com/wiki/Control \"Control\")* as a video game, including the player and the game's content rating.","__metadata":{"id":"2r4uIGrEonJtQcRYAFY2ig","source":"sourcebit-source-contentful","modelName":"blogPost","projectId":"pyifz91mcau0","projectEnvironment":"master","createdAt":"2020-02-20T19:44:10.511Z","updatedAt":"2020-02-21T17:24:06.584Z"}},{"title":"Jesse Fayden","date":"2020-02-19","description":"Jesse Faden is the current Director of the Federal Bureau of Control.
